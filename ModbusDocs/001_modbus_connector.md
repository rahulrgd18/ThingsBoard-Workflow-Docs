### ðŸ§  Core Python & Standard Library Imports
These provide foundational features:

- `asyncio`, `CancelledError`, `AsyncQueue`, `QueueEmpty`: Used for async programming â€” handles non-blocking operations like reading from Modbus devices.
- `Queue`, `Empty`: A classic, thread-safe FIFO queue (not async).
- `Thread`: Enables parallel execution using threads.
- `choice`, `ascii_lowercase`: For random string generation.
- `monotonic`, `sleep`: Timing functions â€” monotonic avoids issues with system clock changes.
- `packaging.version`: Allows safe semantic comparison of package versions.

### ðŸ§­ ThingsBoard-Specific Imports
These are classes and constants from the ThingsBoard Gateway used to build the connector:

- `ADDRESS_PARAMETER`, `FUNCTION_CODE_PARAMETER`, etc.: Constants related to Modbus configuration.
- `RPCRequest`, `RPCType`: Structures for remote procedure calls.
- `ConvertedData`, `StatisticsService`: Track and handle transformed telemetry and stats.
- `Connector`: Base class for all connectors â€” `AsyncModbusConnector` will inherit from this.
- `TBUtility`, `init_logger`: Utilities for logging and package management.

### ðŸ“¦ Dynamic Dependency Handling
Before importing `pymodbus`:

```python
try:
    # import pymodbus and check version
except ImportError:
    # install missing packages using TBUtility
```

This logic ensures dependencies (`pymodbus`, `pyserial`, `pyserial-asyncio`) are present â€” upgrading/downgrading if needed â€” pretty robust for runtime config.

---

### ðŸ§± Modbus Gateway Components
Once dependencies are resolved, we import:

- `Master`, `Slave`, `Server`: Represent different roles in Modbus communication.
- `BytesDownlinkConverterConfig`: Converts binary data to usable telemetry.
- `BackwardCompatibilityAdapter`: Keeps older configs working with newer logic.

---

### ðŸ›  Pymodbus Imports
These cover all Modbus message types, errors, and configuration helpers (like `Endian`).

This file is setting the stage for a threaded, asynchronous Modbus connector within ThingsBoard. Nothing too exotic yetâ€”but it's packing a lot of structure behind the scenes. Send the next chunk when youâ€™re ready, and Iâ€™ll walk you through it.
